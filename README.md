Assignment 2 from Comp3308
Authors: Nicholas Zaidan & William Smith

The assignment required us to implement the K-Nearest Neighbour and Na√Øve Bayes algorithm to read a dataset, and predict whether the user
has diabetes or not. We then compared our classifier to other classifiers such as Weka. We performed well receiving 19.625/20 and meeting
the all the test cases given to us.
